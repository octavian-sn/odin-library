# odin-library
Project: Library from TheOdinProject curriculum

What started out as an apparently easy and fast project, turned out to be more than expected.

The point was to use object constructors in order not to bloat the code unnecessarily, I got the chance to use DOM manipulation more than the previous projects, which was quite handy, and I also had to figure out how to create a popup.

Displaying books was to be done either on an individual "card" or in a table, I chose the table method because I considered it to be more challenging, and I think I was right, because I had to adjust the table in order to make it not to look like an ordinary ugly table, lol xD. In the end it was good, as I got to practice drawing tables too.
